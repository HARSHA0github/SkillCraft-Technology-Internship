## 📘 About
During my month‑long virtual internship, I worked with a structured curriculum provided by SkillCraft Technology, designed to strengthen data science and machine learning skills
---

## Projects Overview

### Task 1 – House Price Prediction
- **Goal:** Create predictive models based on number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
- **Approach:** Applied Linear Regression to forecast pricing.
- **Outcome:** Trained and evaluated model, analyzed performance metrics such as RMSE/R².

### Task 2 – Customer Segmentation
- **Goal:** Cluster retail customers by purchase behavior.
- **Approach:** Employed K‑means clustering, experimented with different `k` values.
- **Outcome:** Surface meaningful customer segments to inform marketing decisions.

### Task 3 – SVM: Cat vs. Dog Classification
- **Goal:** Distinguish cat and dog images using SVM.
- **Approach:** Utilized Kaggle dataset, performed feature extraction (e.g., HOG) + support vector machine classifier.
- **Outcome:** Achieved notable classification accuracy; visualized true vs. false positives.

### Task 4 – Hand Gesture Recognition
- **Goal:** Detect and classify various hand gestures from images/videos.
- **Approach:** Incorporated computer vision techniques and possibly CNN architectures for gesture classification.
- **Outcome:** Built a working gesture recognition prototype designed for gesture-based interaction systems.
